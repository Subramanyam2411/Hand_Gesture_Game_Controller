# Hand_Gesture_Game_Controller
Hand Gesture Game Controller that lets you play games using real-time hand movements via your webcam! No keyboard, no mouseâ€”just AI-powered control with intuitive hand gestures.
This project leverages MediaPipe and OpenCV to track index finger movements and translates them into arrow key inputs using PyAutoGUI. The left/right controls are reversed to match the mirrored camera view, ensuring a seamless experience.
